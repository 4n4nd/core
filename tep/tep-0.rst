What is a TEP?
==============

TEP stands for Thoth Enhancement Proposal.  A TEP is a design
document providing information to the Thoth community, or describing
a new feature for any Thoth component or its processes or environment.
A TEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature 
and a rationale for the feature.

We intend TEP to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Thoth. The TEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

We mimic PEP [1]_, replacing the BDFL with an architecture board, and 
starting the numbering at the first natural number rather than 1.

TEP Architecture board
======================

Memebers of the TEP Architecture board are:

* Christoph Görn
* Fridolín Pokorný
