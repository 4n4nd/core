# Terms and Conditions for the Thoth Station Scrum

Thoth Station Hibabitants, v0.3.0, 2021-Mar-30

A scrum sprint (or iteration) is 2 weeks of calendar time, and a task shouldcan not span more than one sprint.
If a task can not be accomplished in one sprint it must be broken up. Issues are created by the team. Issues are
assigned to persons (they become an assignee of the issue) when a person picks up the card and starts working on
it (pulls it into the ‘in progress’ list).

An Issue must include a User Story, a list of Acceptance Criteria, (optionally) a link to a Key Result, and a
measure of complexity/time estimate. A list of References to the prior art, external documents, … could be included.
Time is equivalent to the splits of an iteration you need to deliver the complexity of ana issue.

Links to PRs that are implementing/fulfilling the acceptance criteria should be included as a comment on the issue.
It must be present if the issue is closed.

We have a list of Projects to cluster issues into contexts, but issues must not be on a project, they can also be just
within a repository.

Issues are managed on GitHub, we use [labels](https://github.com/thoth-station/core/blob/master/community/labels.md).

## Issue Priorities

An issue’s priority is mainly derived from its relation to a key result, but could also be influenced by the team.

Applying any "priority/" label is only ok before the backlog refinement session, it shall indicate that the card is
important to the team, or important to support an upcoming key result. During the refinement session, the issue should
be planned accordingly.

## Backlog Refinement Session

The team is refining the set and content of the issues in any ‘new’ or 'backlog' list of any of [Thoth Station Projects](https://github.com/orgs/thoth-station/projects).
The goal of the backlog refinement session if to prepare all issues to:

* have a User Story
* list of high-level Acceptance Criteria/Goals (that is signed off by the team, and unchangeable)
* categorization if it is a [spike]
* checklist of detailed Acceptance Criteria (that might extend over the lifetime of the card)
* (optional) a measure of complexity (story points)/time estimate
* list of References
* might have a due date assigned and confirmed by the team lead

## Sprint Planning Session (experiment: integrate it with backlog refinement session)

Pull the issues which support the high-level team objectives/theme and key results into the ‘next’ list, so that the
team is clear of what is to be worked on in the next sprint.

During the session, issues are open to allocation to any team member, and the team agrees to the interested team member
to work on the issue. If the interested team member needs to be trained to fulfil the task, then a 'th
task has to be added and taken by the team member. If the training task is not feasible, another team member should
take the initial task.

## Scrum Standup

This activity is subject to review next! We want to broaden the communication and unfreeze the behaviours of a
multicultural geographically dispersed team.

How do we do that?
Maybe by asking: Can we achieve the scrum goal? Are you Blocked? Could someone help you? Can we demo all the tasks we
will have done at the end of the scrum? What can we communicate to the outside of the team at the end of the scrum?

## Sprint Demo

Scrum demos will be recorded and have meeting minutes. Every team member is encouraged to demo the work of the past
sprint. Demos are published to [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUIDuq_hQ6vlzmqM59B2Lw).

## Sprint Retrospective

This activity is for reviewing what went well/not well regarding the past sprint. A discussion like what was the better
aspect we would like to continue? What should be aspects that need more discussion as a team? What could have been a
better way to proceed?
